    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ol>
<li>Bread – a thicker sliced bread such as texas toast works best</li>
<li>Butter – use a generous 1/2 Tbsp of butter on each slice of bread. We use unsalted but any butter will work here.</li>
<li>Cheese – we use a combination of sliced medium cheddar, gouda and Havarti cheese. </li>
 </ol>


 <h2>Instructions</h2>

 <ol>
<li>Butter the toast – spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread. </li>
<li>Heat skillet – place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. A griddle should be at 275˚F. Immediately add 2 slices of bread with the butter-side-down. </li>
<li>Add cheese – stack cheeses on one of the pieces of bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over. </li>
<li>Brown the toast – Continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted. </li>
<li>Serves– cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal to serve. </li>
 </ol>
